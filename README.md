# Bogusz Janiak ML Project - House Prices: Advanced Regression Techniques

This notebook will show a full workflow of building a regression model for the House Prices competition at Kaggle. This contest is focusing on Feature Engineering and using advanced regression techniques. The best score I have achieved using the techniques presented in this notebook is **0.11931**, and this currently places me in the **top 5%** of all competitors.
The project has six main sections:
1. Introduction
2. Explanatory Data Analysis
3. Feature Engineering
4. Pre-Modeling Tasks
5. Modeling
6. Final prediction & submission
